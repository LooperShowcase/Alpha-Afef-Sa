      Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro GOIH ComM (Portuguese pronunciation:
      [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional
      footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Professional
      League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as
      one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or
      awards[note 3] and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European
      player. He has won 32 trophies in his career, including seven league
      titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and
      the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances
      (183), goals (140), and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the
      European Championship (14), men's international goals (122), and men's
      international appearances (198). He is one of the few players to have made
      over 1,100 professional career appearances, and has scored over 800
      official senior career goals for club and country. Ronaldo began his
      senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in
      2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go on to win
      three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA
      Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the
      subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he
      signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80
      million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with
      Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which was integral to the team winning four
      Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. During this
      period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in
      2016 and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his
      perceived career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer
      and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the
      competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and
      2018. With Real, Ronaldo won two La Liga titles, two Copas del Rey, four
      Champions Leagues, three UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In
      2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million
